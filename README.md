# Exercise 3: The Big Z

Write a function that takes in an n x m two-dimensional array (that can be square-shaped when n == m) and returns a one-dimensional array of all the array's elements in zigzag order.

Zigzag order starts at the top left corner of the two-dimensional array, goes down by one element, and proceeds in a zigzag pattern all the way to the bottom right corner.

Sample Input:
array = [
    [1, 3, 4, 10],
    [2, 5, 9, 11],
    [6, 8, 12, 15],
    [7, 13, 14, 16],
]

Sample Output:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
